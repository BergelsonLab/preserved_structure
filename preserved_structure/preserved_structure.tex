\begin{abstract}
Certain concepts, words, and images are intuitively more similar than
others (dog vs.~cat, dog vs.~spoon), though quantifying such similarity
is notoriously tricky. Indeed, this kind of computation is likely a
critical part of learning the category boundaries for words within a
given language. Here, we use a set of items (n= 27, e.g. `dog') that are
highly common in young infants' input, and use both image-based and
word-based algorithms to independently compute similarity among these
items. We find two key results. First, the pair-wise item similarities
derived within image-space and word co-occurrence-space are correlated,
suggesting evidence of preserved structure among these extremely
different representational formats. Second, the `closest' neighbors for
each item computed within each space overlap significantly. We further
discuss the potential role of animacy in a set of exploratory analyses.
We conclude that this approach, which does not rely on human ratings of
similarity, may nevertheless reflect stable within-class structure
across these two spaces. We speculate that such invariance, in turn,
might aid in lexical acquisition, by serving as an informative marker of
category boundaries.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Infants are presented with a challenge to carve the world into distinct
lexical entities in the process of learning their first language.
They're provided with little supervision while mapping a territory that
William James (1890) famously dubbed a ``great blooming, buzzing
confusion''. How they determine which aspects of the world to attend to
in service of this goal is an area of ongoing research and debate
(Mareschal \& Quinn, 2001). Relatedly, features of objects and their
environments are varyingly informative with regards to object
segmentation and category structure. Some researchers have suggested
that categorization is along fundamentally perceptual grounds and that
only later in development is conceptual knowledge incorporated into
these nascent perceptual categories (Quinn \& Eimas, 1997, 2000; Quinn,
Johnson, Mareschal, Rakison, \& Younger, 2000). Others suggest that
there are in fact two distinct processes at work, such that perceptual
categories are computed automatically by the sensory systems, while
conceptual categories are independently formed through conscious action
(Mandler, 2000). Tr√§uble and Pauen (2007) provide evidence of functional
information (regarding the animacy of objects) influencing early
category judgements. Gelman and Markman (1986) explicitly set these two
sources of category cues against each other (i.e.~functional
vs.~perceptual), and find that preschoolers can override perceptual
overlap in reasoning about functional similarity, in natural kinds.
\textbf{add some smith, waxman refs}

The degree to which conceptual and perceptual information are separable,
both in early learning, and in adult experts, is an important open
question. Any model which hopes to explain the mechanics of human
categorization must address how these potentially disparate
information-sources interface in mental representations, and to what
degree they interact. Indeed, evidence from human learners suggests they
integrate perceptual and linguistic information during categorization
and learning (\textbf{REFS e.g.~some of ref 12-19 in Waxman and Gelman
2009}). Here we take first steps in a deliberately different approach.
We separate computations over images and words, and then compare the
overlap in the similarity among items that these systems deduce. Using a
set of highly familiar and common words and concepts from a large infant
corpus, we compare the output of an image analysis, and a word
co-occurrence analysis for these same items. We use algorithms that
learn feature representations without hand engineering, purely as a
byproduct of their particular (and separate) training objectives
(e.g.~natural language processing or object recognition in images).
Comparing the representations these algorithms learn, we gain a window
into the structure of visual and semantic forms.

Delineating the differences between words, concepts, and categories in
the abstract, and the processes underlying identifying, understanding,
or comparing particular instances of them in the world is not trivial.
For present purposes, we stick to concrete, `basic level' nouns that are
early-acquired, since our underlying question concerns how such words
are learned. We assume that nouns refer to concepts, which have
categorical boundaries (such that cats are not in the `dog' category),
while acknowledging that multiple nouns can refer to a given concept,
and different concepts can be called to mind by a given word. We further
assume that specific instances of words in natural language production,
and specific images of the concept a word picks out are both used by
learners to inform their understanding of what the word means, and what
the category boundaries of the concept are. Hereafter we use the term
`item' to refer to the words/concepts we examine.

\section{Methods}\label{methods}

\subsection{Items}\label{items}

<<<<<<< HEAD
The 27 items analyzed here were selected due to their high frequency in
infants' early visual and linguistic input, aggregated as part of the
SEEDLingS project, which gathered longitudinal audio and video data of
infants' home environments from 6-17 months (Bergelson, 2016a, 2016b).
We describe this larger study in brief, simply to relay how the items we
analyze were chosen; the details of this larger study are not critical
to the present work. In the larger study, 44 infants were tested every
other month (from 6-18 months) on common nouns, using a
looking-while-listening eyetracking design in which two images are shown
on a screen, and one is named. The words for these experiments were
chosen by dint of being high frequency or well known across infants in
other samples (e.g.~Brent Corpus, WordBank \textbf{BRENT \& SISKIND
2001}(Frank, Braginsky, Yurovsky, \& Marchman, 2017)), or by being one
of the top 10 concrete nouns heard in each infants' own home audio and
video recordings in the preceding two months.

The 27 items (i.e.~words and images) analyzed here were selected due to
their high frequency in infants' early visual and linguistic input,
aggregated as part of the SEEDLingS project, which gathered longitudinal
audio and video data of infants' home environments from 6-17 months (E.
Bergelson, 2016a, 2016b). We describe this larger study in brief, simply
to relay how the items we analyze were chosen; the details of this
larger study are not critical to the present work. In the larger study,
44 infants were tested every other month (from 6-18 months) on common

audio and video recordings in the preceding two months.
>>>>>>> 27cc435bbff6582309355697b1ad71427bdd14b6

The images displayed when these words were tested were chosen from a
library of prototypical images of a given word (e.g.~dog), along with
images of infants' own versions of the items, as seen in their home
videos (e.g.~a given infant's cat, specific bottle, etc.). To enter the
current analysis, images had to occur 9 or more times in this image
library of high frequency concrete nouns \textbf{add M(SD) R for \#
images and \# basic level tokens in allbasiclevel}. Thus, the words and
images used here were highly common across our 500+ daylong
audio-recordings and 500+ hourlong video-recordings from 44 infants,
providing an ecologically-valid item-set for present modeling purposes.

The images of the 27 items used to derive average category image-vectors
were all 960x960pixel photos of a single object on a gray background.
All items correspond to words found on WordBank (Frank et al., 2017), a
compilation of the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory,
which we use as a proxy for age of acquisition below (Dale \& Fenson,
1996).

\subsection{Vector Representations}\label{vector-representations}

We generate two sets of vector representations for a common set of
early-learned items. The first set of vectors are taken from a
pretrained set of GloVe representations (Pennington, Socher, \& Manning,
2014), a modern distributional semantic vector space model. The second
set is taken from the final layer activations of a pretrained image
recognition model, Google's Inception V3 convolutional neural network
(Szegedy, Vanhoucke, Ioffe, Shlens, \& Wojna, 2016). Both of these
representations are generally referred to as ``embeddings''. They map
objects from one medium (e.g.~images or words) into a metric space where
distances between points can be computed and function as a measure of
similarity between objects.

\subsubsection{Word Vectors}\label{word-vectors}

In the case of our word vectors, the GloVe algorithm instantiates the
distributional hypothesis, which proposes that words which co-occur with
each other share similar meaning (Firth, 1957; Harris, 1954), whereby
capturing the covariance of tokens in large text corpora, captures
aspects of their semantic structure. We use the set of vectors
pretrained by the GloVe authors on the Common Crawl corpus with 42
billion tokens, resulting in 300 dimensional vectors for 1.9 million
unique words\footnote{\url{https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/}}.
Such vectors have shown promise in modeling early semantic networks
(Amatuni \& Bergelson, 2017). Thus, in word-vector space, each of our 27
items is represented as a 300-dimensional vector, with each word
assigned a unique point in a common vector space.

\subsubsection{Image Vectors}\label{image-vectors}

The image embeddings are taken from the final layer of activations in a
convolutional neural network, whose objective function tunes network
parameters in service of object recognition, where the loss function is
computed in reference to a set of labeled training images (Russakovsky
et al., 2015). The final layer of this network encodes the most abstract
and integrated visual features, serving as the basis for classification
into 1000 different classes.

Unlike for the word vectors we use, different images containing of the
same item will have varying vector representations after passing through
the layers of a neural network. This presents a problem in comparing the
two forms of representation. We must first define the most prototypical
(or average) image vector for any given category of object, which will
generate our 2048-dimensional representation for each of the 27 items,
in image-space.

Given a set of images \(S_c\) containing objects belonging to a single
category \(c\) (e.g.~cat, dog, chair), we define our prototypical vector
\(\hat{x}_c\) of \(S_c\) as the generalized median within a
representational space \(U\). This is the vector with minimal sum of
distances between it and all the other members of set \(S_c\) in \(U\).
If \(x\) and \(y\) are vectors in space \(U\), products of images in
\(S_c\) being passed through a neural network, then

\[
 \hat{x_c} = \operatorname*{arg\,min}_{x\in U} \sum_{y\in U} d(x, y)
\] We define our \(d(x, y)\) to be the cosine similarity measure:

\[
d(x, y) = 1 - \frac{x\cdot y}{\|x\|\|y\|}
\]

Our \(d(x, y)\) is not a metric in the strict sense, but is less
susceptible to differences in \(L^2\) norm influencing our measure of
similarity, unlike Euclidean distance. Thus in principle, cosine
similarity corrects for frequency effects in training data. All code
used for generating these vectors and for the subsequent analysis can be
found on
Github\footnote{\url{https://github.com/BergelsonLab/preserved_structure}}.

\subsection{Comparing spaces}\label{comparing-spaces}

Having computed our two sets of vectors (i.e.~those from word vector
space and those from image vector space), we can compare all the
pairwise distances between objects, both within a single space and
across the two. When comparing across the two spaces, a correlation in
pairwise distances implies that inter-object distances have been
conserved. For example, if ``dog'' and ``cat'' are close together in
word space and mutually far apart from ``chair'' and ``table'' in that
same space, maintaining this relationship for all pairwise distances in
the \textit{other} vector space means that the global inter-object
structure is preserved across this mapping, despite being in radically
different spaces, both in terms of dimensionality (300 for words, and
2048 for images in our case) and by virtue of using completely different
algorithms and inputs to establish the vector representations for
objects. So while their absolute locations might have been radically
transformed, this correlation would be a measure of the
\textit{degree of invariance} in their positioning relative to each
other.

\section{Results}\label{results}

To test whether image- and word-based similarity converged for this set
of 27 items, we conducted several analyses. First, we tested whether the
pairwise cosine distances for all items in word vector space correlated
with those same pairwise distances in the image vector space (see Figure
\ref{fig:pairwise-corr}). Indeed, we find a significant correlation
among the 351 pairs of distances ((\(R = 0.30\), \(p < 1.5e-08\))).
\footnote{since distances are identical for cat-dog and dog-cat, and since we omit an item's distance to itself (0), there are (27*27-27)/2) comparisons}

Next, we examined the degree to which our set of 27 words shared
overlapping neighbors in the two vector spaces (see Table
\ref{tbl:overlap-table}). We defined `neighbor' by first determining the
mean similarity between each item and the 26 other items. Any items
whose distance to this 'target \textbf{say something clear here} was
considered a neighbor. With this normalized neighborhood threshold, we
find that the majority of items have at least 1 neighbor which is shared
across representational spaces. Within word-space, items had on average
3.29 neighbors, Range 1-5. Within Image-space, items had 2.51 neighbors,
Range 0-6.

<<<<<<< HEAD
We find that neighbor `overlap' across the spaces (i.e.~how many of the
neighbors overlapped, divided by how many neighbors there were) is
significantly greater than 0 (Mean Overlap XX, p\textless{} XX by
Wilcoxon test). This complements the correlational analysis, showing not
just that the distances for any given pair tended to have similar values
in image-space and word-space, but that the \emph{most} similar
words/images for each of the 27 items also were consistent across these
spaces.

\subsubsection{Animacy}\label{animacy}

Given that infants are generally drawn to faces from an early age
(Frank, Vul, \& Johnson, 2009), and that animacy is a robust linguistic
and semantic/syntactic property, we conducted a set of exploratory
analyses to examine animacy effects among our 27 items (of which half
were animates, see Table \ref{tbl:overlap-table}). We first partitioned
the set of inter-word distances into those that are either
<<<<<<< HEAD
animate-animate (e.g.~dog-giraffe, \textbf{n=xx}), inanimate-inanimate
(e.g.~truck-bottle, \textbf{n=xx}), or mixed (e.g.~dog-bottle,
\textbf{n=xx}), and again tested for correlations between image and word
distances. We find that the overall correlation across our items appears
stronger for inanimate pairs, which significantly correlated across our
two spaces (\(R = 0.38\), \(p < 0.00024\)), even adjusting the
significance threshold to .05/3 for this exploration. Correlations
within animate and mixed item-pairs were not significantly different
from chance, though this may be expected with this relatively small set
of items (see Figure \ref{fig:pairwise-corr-animate-vs-not}).

To furher probe whether the animate/inanimate distinction mapped onto
early learning of these items, we looked at their relative rates of
=======
animate-animate (e.g.~dog-giraffe, n=xx), inanimate-inanimate
(e.g.~truck-bottle, n=xx), or mixed (e.g.~dog-bottle, n=xx), and again
tested for correlations between image and word distances. We find that
the overall correlation across our items appears stronger for inanimate
pairs, which significantly correlated across our two spaces
(\(R = 0.38\), \(p < 0.00024\)), even adjusting the significance
threshold to .05/3 for this exploration. Correlations within animate and
mixed item-pairs were not significantly different from chance, though
this may be expected with this relatively small set of items (see Figure
\ref{fig:pairwise-corr-animate-vs-not}).

To examine whether the animate/inanimate distinction mapped onto early
learning of these items, we looked at their relative rates of
>>>>>>> 27cc435bbff6582309355697b1ad71427bdd14b6
acquisition in WordBank (Frank et al., 2017). Given that the inanimate
items showed the strongest correlation across spaces, we predicted that
these items may be learned earlier than the animates. That is, in
principle, one would expect that those classes of objects which preserve
their structure between representations more strongly would result in
earlier word-referent mappings. This is because inferences about
word-referent mappings conditioned on both visual and semantic features
would be more stable compared to those cases where the two
representations vary independently. For example, an object that is both
round (i.e.~visual feature) and tends to partake in rolling events
(i.e.~semantic feature) would be more salient as a distinct entity than
an object whose visual features are entirely uninformative about its
functional or semantic qualities.

Here, the sub-group of objects which displayed stronger structure
preservation (within class) are the inanimate objects. When we partition
our set of 27 words into animates and inanimates and compare their
relative rates of acquisition (averaging across 8-18 months for the
MCDI-Words and Gestures as a comprehension proxie, and 16-30 months from
MCDI-Words and Sentences as a production proxie), we find a trend
towards higher knowledge for inanimates, though this difference was not
significant (see Figures \ref{fig:animacy-aoa-prod-graph} and
\ref{fig:animacy-aoa-comp-graph}). While this initial exploration did
not reveal notable mappings between acquisition timelines and image-word
space correlations, we feel that further investigation (using larger
datasets) may provide insight in future investigations.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

The results above revealed a significant correspondence between
representations learned by two different algorithms operating over
inputs in two fundamentally different encoding formats (i.e.~visual and
linguistic). We find that not only are the relative distances among
these 27 common, early-learned items correlated across word- and
image-vector space, but that even at the item-level, the `closest' words
in both spaces overlap as well. What is most noteworthy here is that the
only immediate common ground between these representations are the real
life concepts they both aim to model. This is particularly notable given
the enormous dimensionality of our feature spaces, and the fact that
these algorithms are placed under no pressure to find homologous
representations.

The notion that we can make inferences about one aspect of an object
given another aspect, is not surprising or controversial. Rather than
considering multiple dimensions of an word or concept at once, as real
learners must, here we show that even with the experiences parcelled out
separately into visual and linguistic spaces, what count as `similar' is
conserved.

Through what metrics can a learning algorithm, or indeed a human,
establish gradations of likeness? Are these necessarily the same metrics
which form the basis of category boundaries? These are fundamental
questions which have enjoyed a long history in the field (Edelman, 1998;
Hahn, Chater, \& Richardson, 2003; Kemp, Bernstein, \& Tenenbaum, 2005;
Shepard \& Chipman, 1970; Tversky, 1977). While our current work is not
sufficient to support a specific mechanism responsible for the observed
regularity, it might be indicative of the special role of invariance,
given that the unifying thread between our algorithms and inputs are the
common objects they represent. Underneath the diversity of visual
statistics and token distributions lie stable entities in the world
which, by virtue of their invariant actuality, give rise to regularity
across measurements at different vantage points (i.e.~modalities), an
idea dating back to Helmholtz (1878).

While in principle, the animacy dimension may have been a fruitful
ground We find in our current work that this quality of invariance is
differentially present across different classes of entities, namely
animate vs.~inanimate objects. However, this is conditioned on the
particular algorithms we've investigated here, and our extensions into
human performance with our AoA anlysis did not show a significant
sensitivity to this difference. This could suggest a number things. The
first is that humans might not discover the regularities that these
algorithms do. Or it could be that our current class partitioning does
not provide sufficient contrast in invariance to register human AoA
differences. Or it could be that regularity is not a determining factor
in ease of acquisition. Of these three, the last is least likely to be
the case.

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

We find evidence of an interaction between visual and semantic features
learned by two distinct machine learning algorithms which operate over
drastically different inputs, and are trained in the service of
seemingly unrelated ends. This interaction is indicative of conserved
structure between these two supposedly independent sources of
information (i.e.~visual and functional). If humans are sensitive to
this relationship, as these algorithms seem to be, we expect that those
classes of object which are more strongly invariant across feature
spaces would be more easily learned by infants. We find a noticeable
though insignificant relationship between this property and AoA in our
current partitioning scheme (animates vs.~inanimates).
